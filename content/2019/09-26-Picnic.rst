Data Warehouse Automation in Python
------------------------------------

At Picnic, decisions are always backed by data. Coming from a variety of systems, this data is then crunched with the help of Python and SQL. During this talk, we will walk you through our journey of building the ultimate source of truth, the Data Warehouse. We will also show you how Python has helped us create a Data Vault capture framework, and how we applied strong Software Engineering principles to ensure our pipelines are always robust and maintainable.

Detecting Outages at Scale
--------------------------
Sometimes the internet is having a bad day, and Facebook, Instagram or Whatsapp doesn't work. You and countless of other people rush to downdetector.com to check if that's really the case. Here's our story about the last Facebook outage, and how we made our service scale.

Getting started with FPGA with Python
-------------------------------------
FPGA is becoming more and more popular in many fields such as IOT, video processing. It also used to make computations for machine learning and trading technologies more effective. Unfortunately for newbies to this technology, it is quite complicated and usually requires using specific languages: Verilog and/or VHDL. But with frameworks such as myVDL and PYNQ Python developers also can explore these opportunities. We'll look into FPGA technology, touch what it is and where and how it's used. Also, where can Python developers start and what they can achieve.
