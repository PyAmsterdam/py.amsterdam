Abstract
~~~~~~~~

The Steering Council has recently approved PEPs 634-636,
which means that Python 3.10 will include a "Pattern Matching"
feature similar to what's available in other languages, although
with some of its own pythonic flavour. This presentation will give
a quick overview of the feature and its applications, some additional insights
about why it was designed the way it is,
and how we can expect it to evolvein the future.

Abstract
~~~~~~~~
"Teams change often. People leave and people join. In addition to those changes, we tend to forget what we were thinking.
That's why it's a good practice to document those thoughts,
discussions and decisions into a format that doesn't lose them.
In this talk I explore ways to use tools and
processes you might be familiar with - version control and project management tools - to help you document the motivation,
thoughts and intents behind changes when they happen.
You'll get practical tips that you can take back to your work the next day.
