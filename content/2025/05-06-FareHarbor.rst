About Iulia Feroli: After working on many sides of tech, I have finally found my perfect
match as a developer advocate at Elastic - focusing on creating content for, and learning
from the tech community. I specialise in data science & AI solutions and love creating
videos, blogs, demos and sessions to get people excited about the possibilities of tech.
I love to talk about anything NLP, cloud, data science 101, MLOPs, generative AI, and more.


Abstract
~~~~~~~~

Wrapped has become one of the most widely anticipated data analytics
dashboards of the year. But what happens when the results aren't as
complex (or accurate) as people were expecting? Data scientists come
in to save the day!

Using Elasticsearch and Kibana, I will create my own musical trends and
insights using user-generated data—which you can also download and
follow along with! From queries, filters, and aggregations to
visualizations, time series analysis, and brat summer—we will explore
how search analytics can be used for everyday cases.
