Choosing Between Free Threading and Async
-----------------------------------------

About Samet Yaslan: Samet has been chairing the Python Standards Group 
at Optiver since 2021, with the mission of standardizing Python codebases 
by making best practices known to everyone in the company.

He advocates for clean, simple, and well-tested code. Samet has earned 
his living using Python for more than 10 years and began participating 
in the open-source CPython project last year.

He continues to contribute with new pull requests occasionally and 
really enjoys the opportunity to give back!



Abstract
~~~~~~~~

With the removal of the GIL, is async still necessary in Python? 

Python 3.13 introduces PEP 703, which eliminates the GIL and allows 
true multi-threading and parallel execution across CPU cores. 

In this talk, we'll explore how this change impacts the choice between 
threading and async programming. We'll compare their strengths and 
weaknesses, exploring when to use each—whether for CPU-bound tasks 
with threads or I/O-bound operations with async. 

By the end, you'll gain a clear perspective on which model best suits 
your needs, helping you make more informed and efficient decisions 
in your Python projects.

PydanticAI & Logfire
---------------------

About `Marcelo Trylesinski`_: Marcelo maintains Starlette & Uvicorn on his free time,
and he is currently working at Pydantic - focusing on PydanticAI.


Abstract
~~~~~~~~

In this talk, we're going to walk through the basics of PydanticAI,
and integrate it with Logifre. We'll see how we can run our agents,
and make sure we monitor our application properly.
