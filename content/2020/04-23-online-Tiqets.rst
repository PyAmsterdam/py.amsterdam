Abstract
~~~~~~~~

Python type hinting and how we use it at Tiqets to have stable, self-documenting, maintainable code.

Memory address in python!
--------------------------

`Mridu Bhatnagar`_ is a software engineer.
She loves paying it forward and giving back to the community.
When not programming she is usually giving talks, taking workshops at various community meetups.

Abstract
~~~~~~~~

Let us understand what is happening to the memory address when you
are working with built-in objects like (``int``, ``str``, ``bool``, ``lists``,
``dictionaries``, ``set``).


Minimal containers for your Python application
----------------------------------------------

About `Mircea Cosbuc`_:

I am a back-end developer turned Dev Ops. I spent most of my development years writing
Python, which might explain the transition.

Abstract
~~~~~~~~

Your Python application is running in a container, great! What can you do now
to make this container as small as possible and why would you even bother?
We're going to discuss the need of creating the smallest container image possible,
observe some methods to achieve it and reflect on whether the journey was worth it.
