Abstract
~~~~~~~~

Python type hinting and how we use it at Tiqets to have stable, self-documenting, maintainable code.

Memory address in python!
--------------------------

About `Mridu Bhatnagar`_:

10 years of experience in IT, mainly as System Admin/DevOps/Cloud Native Engineer.
I like to code as well. I contribute to Open Source whenever I can and I like to share my knowledge.
When not coding - doing photography :)

Abstract
~~~~~~~~

The intent of this talk is to understand the following mentioned things.
What is ``id``?
Why are list, dicts mutable? While strings, tuples immutable.Through examples.
``a,b = 1, 1``? Whether this leads to a single memory reference ``id`` or 2
different memory reference id.
The difference between ``==`` and ``is``?
Example showing ``*`` operator which copies the memory references.


Minimal containers for your Python application
----------------------------------------------

About `Mircea Cosbuc`_:

I am a back-end developer turned Dev Ops. I spent most of my development years writing
Python, which might explain the transition.

Abstract
~~~~~~~~

Your Python application is running in a container, great! What can you do now
to make this container as small as possible and why would you even bother?
We're going to discuss the need of creating the smallest container image possible,
observe some methods to achieve it and reflect on whether the journey was worth it.
