We thought about what will be best for Pythonistas?
What will be the most Pythonic way to do it?
(Is it a thing?) Hereâ€™s our journey in making WOQLpy and we want to make it useful to you.

The past few weeks have been difficult for tech communities in general
and for the Python community. I'll talk a little about the importance
of building communities and give some background on how the PSF is
dealing with the current situation, and answer questions.
