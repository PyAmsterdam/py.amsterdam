About: Artem Zhukov

Python software engineer @RedHat @OAMG

Python Software engineer with more than 4 years of experience.
Interested in web applications, everything which uses python asyncio, DevOps, infrastructure automation, bots etc.
Compliment projects with machine learning, growing as a professional, learning new technologies, experimenting and building interesting products.
I am pedantic in terms of writing clean and simple code, testing and documenting my work.
And I have a big passion to the python asyncio stack. More info at my website_

Abstract
~~~~~~~~

Asyncio is used to be well known for building server side apps,
here the majority of runtime spent on network IO bound tasks.
In this talk, we'll take a look on very different angle of
using the asyncio - building a CLI utilities.


Applied Machine Learning: Leak detection in water pipelines
-----------------------------------------------------------

Hello, my name is Andrea.
I am a devoted organizer of Pyladies Munich and PhD student at the Chair of Databases
and Data Mining at LMU Munich. In my offline free time, you can find me doing yoga,
experimenting in the kitchen or riding my bicycle while singing out loud some Queen.üë©‚Äçüé§üé§

Abstract
~~~~~~~~


This project is part of a university's practical course.
Anomaly Detection and Localization in big industrial facilities is one important application
field of Artificial Intelligence nowadays.
As part of Munich's University program and in cooperation with
Stadtwerken M√ºnchen I got to participate in a one week hackathon-like project,
where based on auditory data we built and evaluated different
Machine Learning models to detect and localize leaks in water systems
all over the city. If you are interested in Machine Learning topics and
would like to know how a real life field use-case looks like,
please feel welcome to join this talk.
