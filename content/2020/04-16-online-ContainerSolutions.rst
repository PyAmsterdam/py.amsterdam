About Software Circus
--------------------------

`Software Circus`_ <more text here>

We are a motley crew of dreamers who are unhealthily obsessed with consuming information and
changing ourselves and those around us. We love software,
tech and anything (from any discipline) that is going to change the world.
Apart from our wider focus, we believe that meetups should be a lot of fun where laughing
out loud and meeting new people is built in, not an opt-in extra.

I am a maintainer of Evegenie project which allows automatic generation of Python Eve
configuration based on JSON file. What it means is that you can auto generate whole
